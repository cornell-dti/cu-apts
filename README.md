## About

Helping the Cornell community at-large find reviews and information about housing and landlords.

## Getting Started

You will need Node.js and Yarn installed on your development machine.

To setup your environment, go into the root folder and run `yarn`. This installs the necessary
dependencies in each required Yarn workspace. Then, run `yarn start` to start a development server
for frontend and backend in parallel. If you specifically want to run either the frontend or backend
on its own, run `yarn workspace frontend start` or `yarn workspace backend start`.
