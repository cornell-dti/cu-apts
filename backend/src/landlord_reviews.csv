,,2,,,,,,,,"I recently moved into this specific apartment just at the start of June. Thus far, I have had nothing significantly noteworthy in terms of complaints regarding management or the building. The apartment was predominantly clean when I moved in, with only minor issues. One apartment issue - electrical related - I have yet to hear back on besides ""We'll contact the electrician."" I've taken to not using the outlets which pose reliability issues. 

I am able to provide experiences about previous landlords over the years in Ithaca. (Most of which were not stellar)",6/17/2020
,,14,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,I've really enjoyed this apartment. I lived in an apartment of 6 and it was still quite spacious for us. My only gripes would be the kitchen is a little too small for 6 people and the drying/washer machines are kind of weak.,4/10/2021 13:25:38
,,15,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,"I've enjoyed my time living at 312 College Ave. The rent is high but you do get what you pay for. The location is good and I've had no complaints about the staff, maintenance, security, or anything like that. Utilities except for electricity are also covered. My kitchen was recently upgraded for free which is a plus. My only problem with this apartment is its price.",3/31/2021 17:34:03
,,16,4,1,3,4,4,4,4,"I enjoy the cheap, affordable living space as well as the cheap parking. However, it is too far from campus and Collegetown, and there is an extra slope to walk up in order to go anywhere.",3/31/2021 23:48:33
,,12,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pretty spacious, reasonable rent price, and an overall good place to live! It's pretty close to Collegetown so location is also convenient. Apartment was pretty clean when we moved in!",3/30/2021 21:18:01
,,12,3,4,4,5,2,2,3,"Overall my experience has been pretty good outside of maintenance issues. The location is very close to campus and the apartment is quite spacious for something at this price point. Furthermore, since the apartment is mirrored, we have two of everything, like kitchens, appliances, bathrooms, etc. which is quite convenient. If you're not worried about having the nicest apartment or dealing with maintenance, it is a fine apartment!",3/30/2021 14:54:18
,,8,4,4,4,5,5,3,5,"Great location to everything and right above Greenstar. Everything is good and the rooms are really pretty. Floors are very sturdy so you can exercise in it. Walls are kind of thin and you can hear roommates. Bathroom and kitchen facilities are average. Rooms are really big but the shared living space is smaller than expected. The major downside I have of the apartment is that I live on the college avenue side on the 2nd floor so I can hear everything outside. It is really annoying and wakes me up in the morning and keeps up at night. If it was a normal semester it would be 100x more annoying with the parties in Collegetown. It is a good apartment, but I do not think it is worth the price. Also, I would not live in the same room again because the noise from the street was too annoying. I think people in other locations of the apartment wouldn't have that complaint though.",3/31/2021 19:44:59
,,4,4,4,4,3,5,3,5,"I think overall it's pretty good but during COVID-19, they are not being very understanding. For example, many international students weren't able to travel back to Ithaca and they hoped to defer or terminate the lease. However, the CTT staff won't allow termination of lease at all and we must sublet the house with a lower rate by ourselves. At the same time, they allowed certain tenants to defer the lease, which is very unfair and confusing.",3/31/2021 0:08:31
,,5,2,4,3,2,2,1,1,"The landlord is very hard to deal with. When I first moved in she said she cleaned the apartment and shampooed the carpets before our move in date, but it was very clear that she did neither; the carpets had large stains all over them and the apartment didn't look like it had been cleaned anytime recently. In the begining of the fall semester, she scheduled a tour without letting us know and people just randomly and unexpectedly walked into the apartment. Besides that, the apartment is not well maintained. It needs new furniture and the carpets need to be cleaned. I would not recommend this place to anyone. ",4/3/2021 21:32:53
,,5,1,4,3,2,1,2,1,"Overall, the apartment itself is spacious and in a good location a 15 min walk to campus. It had the potential to be a good apt because of its space and location but all the other issues made the experience really bad. The landlord was often rude and not understanding; she made us pay 7 months of rent (2 months security deposit and 5 months shortly after) before our lease started and before we even got the keys. At the time, the pandemic had just started and everything was up in the air, and we didn't know what our plans were, and she was threatening to press charges a whole week before the 5 months of rent was even due.",4/10/2021 13:46:10
,,13,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Renting at this location has been my best rental experience in Ithaca! The biggest pro is that it's an excellent value - the property is so well renovated and taken care of that living in the unit is seamless, and the proximity to several locations cannot be beaten. ",3/30/2021 18:31:58
,,6,3,4,5,4,4,4,4,"The landlord is pretty nice, and the location and living conditions are decent. The views outside the window are not great though, and the price is a bit steep (probably because of the location). Rent needs to be paid via check, which is inconvenient if you're not in Ithaca. Trash and laundry are not included in the rent, and if you need parking you need to buy a spot through a third party.",3/29/2021 23:58:10

,,10,4,5,4,2,3,3,2,"The apartment is on the expensive side for its condition and maintenance. The positive thing is its location, which is really close to campus. The room is small and the condition is below average. No soundproof which can be annoy at times. ",3/31/2021 23:30:14
,,10,3,4,5,3,5,4,3,Pretty good - kind of rough for corona since it is a little small at times and Ithaca collegetown kids do pull up outside late at night because it's on a more major road.,4/4/2021 22:53:05
,,10,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,"Despite the rather expensive pricing, the location (right in the heart of Collegetown) covers most of the small issues. Plus, although this might be a unique advantage of high floor apartments, the street noise is nearly inaudible. ",4/8/2021 11:40:13
,,10,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pretty good, staff are friendly and responsive. The rent is pretty reasonable compare to other apartments in college town. Super convenient, everything is right downstairs. Need to pick up packages from ithaca renting office.",4/10/2021 13:24:33
,,10,4,5,4,5,4,4,3,"The value is the best part -- only around $765 for a single in the heart of collegetown. It feels a bit jank since you share two bathrooms and a kitchen with the rest of the floor, and it looks run-down on both the inside and outside, but for the price and location I'm not complaining.

Maintenance is also good. They have someone who is always on call and can come within an hour or so. There was one time where I was locked out of my apartment because the door jammed and I called but they didn't come until next morning so I slept on the couch in the common area, but besides that they've been great.",4/10/2021 13:24:48
,,10,4,5,5,4,4,4,4,The apartment is decently prices and the location is great. The only downside is that we need to physically go to the office to pick up our packages. Maintenance sometimes takes a long time.,4/10/2021 13:22:36
,,10,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,"The apartment is good and I enjoy living here because of its closeness to the campus, good maintenance and closeness to restaurants/stores. The landlord are friendly and send out timely emails about important notices, package arrivals and any such details. While everything is comfortable, sometimes it feels a bit small compared to the price I pay. Overall, I enjoy living here and it's a great place for roommates.",4/10/2021 13:22:37
,,10,3,4,4,2,3,4,2,"This apartment is generally very old. There are some wear-downs in the apartment, but the maintenance service is relatively quick and communicates well. There is not much ventilation in the apartment so it gets quite hot in the summer. The rent is ok, not too high not too low. There is a deli right downstairs (very convenient for snacks :) )",4/10/2021 13:26:11
,,10,5,5,3,4,5,3,4,"I feel like I live pretty close to everyone I know. It's not that far from campus either. I really like having my own kitchen and bathroom. It's so close to the engineering quad and Starbucks, so it's been really convenient",3/31/2021 17:41:47
,,17,4,3,5,4,5,5,4,"The quality price ratio is very good. It's a quiet neighborhood and the layout is not bad. I can get to the main campus within 20 min walk and there's also a bus stop around. The room is not big but it's good enough for me. The landlord provides all necessary furnitures including a microwave, a fridge, and a tv. We don't need to pay anything extra except for the electricity bill. They are also super responsive to our maintenance requests. The layout is a bit weird. The bedrooms are right next to the living room so sometimes it can be a bit distracting when your roommates are hanging out while you need to do work, but this can happen in other places as well and I can just solve it with earbuds. Overall, not the best apartment out there but there's nothing bad about it. Plus the price is super good.",4/10/2021 13:34:46
,,18,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,"I've had a great time overall and would recommend living here, it's just expensive but most of the time it's quiet, but the noise from neighbors still gets through. It's way more loud in the center of collegetown anyway. I would say it's one of the cleanest and well maintained buildings I saw during my tours and I enjoy living there right now.",4/10/2021 13:26:06
,,18,4,5,3,4,4,4,4,"I really like the apartment I live in, the building has about 50 people in it and I know basically everyone. It's also all girls (mainly from my sorority) which is honestly really comforting and it's so fun to know everyone. The staff are pretty helpful when we call for maintenance repairs, but usually it takes a few phone calls and reminders to get them to actually come. It's also pretty expensive. But overall great experience",3/30/2021 13:41:36
,,18,3,4,5,4,3,3,4,"Great experience in a quiet location. The value of the apartment is really good for the price, specifically for the size. Cons are an older building, and a landlord who isn't very responsive.",4/10/2021 13:26:20
,,19,5,4,5,5,4,3,5,"It's a pretty spacious and comfortable apartment, and there are all the necessary amenities provided here. The apartment staff is responsive when we file complaints/need some fixing. Rooms are not too big but the size has never been an issue.",4/9/2021 18:00:16
,,20,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,"I've loved living here and I've had an amazing experience with the landlords as well. Despite being far, it is a great price and the bus stop makes up for it. I'm planning to stay for the next 2 years :))",4/10/2021 13:22:06
,,20,5,4,5,4,5,5,4,"Easy access to laundry and trash. Utilities included, which is a plus. Maintenance is really easy to get done and payments can be made online. Overall great landlord / apartment. Also pet friendly!",4/10/2021 13:24:34
,,4,4,3,4,4,5,4,5,"CTT is the perfect place to live in terms of facilities and price, if not considering accessibility. However, there is a shuttle which runs every 20 min in the morning (used to be 10 min pre-covid) and once every hour in the afternoon until 4:15pm. There's also a dryer and a washing machine in your room.",3/30/2021 0:41:01
,,4,4,3,5,2,4,4,4,"The landlord sometimes seems to be predatory, even when it comes to your lease. They openly say that they will rent your apartment out from under you without notification. I assume as a play to attempt to get tenants to renew their leases. I wouldn't bite at any of these tactics.

Beyond this, I haven't had any problems with safety or cleanliness. They have covered parking under the building, which is my main reason for choosing the apartment.",4/10/2021 13:26:36
,,21,5,4,3,4,4,5,4,"I really enjoyed the fact that it came with plants, couch, and the whole furniture setup. I think the hill might be the worst part in terms of getting to the house but the house itself is nice. Really big closets, washer, dryer, dishwasher etc. ",3/31/2021 11:00:35
,,22,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,"I like staying at this apartment and have made myself at home here. I don't regret choosing this apartment and would choose to stay here again if I were a freshman again. The landlord and management are quite nice and did not do anything unethical. The location of this apartment is quite nice and we're close to a bus route. The only downside to this apartment is that it's dated. However, this apartment is comfortable and I like it here.",3/31/2021 23:16:51
,,23,4,4,3,3,5,4,4,"This apartment is pretty satisfactory. The utilities seem to be pretty high (in the winter it is above $100). The walls and floors are super thin, however, and I can hear basically everything happening in the apartment above and next to ours... Other than that, it's a nice place to call home.",3/31/2021 17:27:06
,,24,4,5,4,4,3,4,3,"Overall, it's a very good location. The apartment is average quality, nothing special but also nothing really bad either. I'm moving to another apartment next semester because this 3 bedroom apartment is too small for 5 people, and all of us wanted our own rooms. It's pretty good for the rent we pay, but obviously it comes at a cost.",3/30/2021 15:22:25
,,24,3,3,2,4,3,3,3,"The location isn't ideal and well there are definitely many more places that are in better condition/have better facilities, but the apartment is big and I get to live with many other friends and we have a fairly big living room that we play games in on a daily basis so I dont regret my choice.",4/10/2021 13:23:46
,,24,4,5,5,3,4,2,4,"Nice living experience with my best friends. We had a lot of great memories there.
But the move-out experience was terrible: because of COVID, my roommates and I all move out in March (2 months before the lease ended). We tried to negotiate a deduction of rent but the leasing company did nothing to help. Also, more than half of our deposit was deducted because of very expensive cleaning fees :(((",4/6/2021 0:53:42
,,24,4,5,5,4,4,4,4,"The location is wonderful, the heater is excellent, and all the essential services are provided (laundry, trash, bug extermination, etc.) The only thing is our wifi was a bit spotty sometimes because of the location of our apartment, but it was a minor inconvenience.",4/10/2021 13:21:39
,,8,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,"The experience is very good. The apartment looks very nice, with big rooms and big beds. The biggest issue is price, which sucks in more than 2/3 of my internship income :(((",4/5/2021 23:00:49
,,8,3,4,3,3,2,2,2,"The people who run Urban Ithaca aren't the best. But, Brad the maintenance man is a goat. The housing is definitely overpriced. And the inside is old and outdated. But, the space and location is nice. ",4/10/2021 13:22:14
,,8,4,5,4,5,3,1,4,"Location is extremely hard to beat! 2 minute walk away from CTB and 3 minutes away from campus. Although the real estate company can do a better job of communicating with us about lease agreements and fines, I would say the house itself is really great for what it is.",4/10/2021 13:22:13
,,25,3,3,4,3,3,4,2,"I would sum up my experience as: serviceable. Do I want to live her long-term? Definitely not, but for a couple semesters, it'll do. The landlord is not the worst I've had, though she could be better and the rent price is fair.",4/6/2021 8:16:36
,,25,3,4,4,3,3,5,2,"Overall I have had somewhat positive experiences here. The location is not ideal but the bus stop makes it very workable. The rooms are generally pretty large and the provided furniture is generally pretty usable (although the bed quality is not great). The biggest issues really come from the fact that many things are quite old. While maintenance is quick, it is still a hassle, and things like the splinter-prone floor and general fragile nature of many objects is unavoidable. ",4/10/2021 13:26:57
