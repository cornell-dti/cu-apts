Walls are kind of thin and you can hear roommates. Bathroom and kitchen facilities are average. Rooms are really big but the shared living space is smaller than expected. The major downside I have of the apartment is that I live on the college avenue side on the 2nd floor so I can hear everything outside. It is really annoying and wakes me up in the morning and keeps up at night. If it was a normal semester it would be 100x more annoying with the parties in Collegetown. It is a good apartment, but I do not think it is worth the price. Also, I would not live in the same room again because the noise from the street was too annoying. I think people in other locations of the apartment wouldn't have that complaint though.",
