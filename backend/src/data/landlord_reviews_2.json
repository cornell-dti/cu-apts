Some people might think it's too far away from campus, but it's not too bad if you use the shuttle bus that runs every 10 minutes in the morning. The price is relatively reasonable compared to the apartments in Collegetown, we have huge parking spaces, there are washer-dryer units built in, there are compost grinders in every kitchen sink.",

Also, there is no concierge, so we have to manually pick up our package. The pro is that price is reasonable and cheap relative to its fairly good facilities. I love how it is modern and the laundry system is inside house. This is very convenient.",
