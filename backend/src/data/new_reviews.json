One apartment issue - electrical related - I have yet to hear back on besides \"We'll contact the electrician.\" I've taken to not using the outlets which pose reliability issues. \n\nI am able to provide experiences about previous landlords over the years in Ithaca.

Walls are kind of thin and you can hear roommates. Bathroom and kitchen facilities are average. Rooms are really big but the shared living space is smaller than expected. The major downside I have of the apartment is that I live on the college avenue side on the 2nd floor so I can hear everything outside. It is really annoying and wakes me up in the morning and keeps up at night. If it was a normal semester it would be 100x more annoying with the parties in Collegetown. It is a good apartment, but I do not think it is worth the price. Also, I would not live in the same room again because the noise from the street was too annoying. I think people in other locations of the apartment wouldn't have that complaint though. ",

In the begining of the fall semester, she scheduled a tour without letting us know and people just randomly and unexpectedly walked into the apartment.

    "reviewText": "Where do I begin? It's been the worst rental experience I've ever had. This is the same complex that had a building burn down in October 2019. I 100% regret moving here but it was the only place I could afford close to Cornell at the time of the year I needed to move.  Among the many issues:\n\nDeceptive rental practices - the apartment I leased did not resemble the condition of the apartments I was shown; the winter utility bills were twice what they estimated them to be. \n\nShoddy record keeping - my rental application had someone else's personal information including SSN in it. \n\nMove-in - the apartment was filthy, peeling paint, with extensive mold, holes in the walls, and many other issues. I refused to accept it and couldn't move in for a week until the major issues were resolved. It still took almost 4 months to get all repairs completed; the repairs often were ad hoc and required multiple efforts to be rectified. Though eventually the repairs got made, it really hasn't addressed the larger ongoing issues that are causing the rapid deterioration of the apartment, such as its extreme draftiness and mold/humidity issues. Other residents I spoke to said their apartments were filthy at move-in as well, and when they complained, the cleaning person returned with only single bleach wipe.\n\nUtter lack of fire safety - The smoke alarms are not wired to a central system because the building is older than, and exempt from, current fire code. So when the building burned down in 2019, no other units' smoke alarms went off and 911 was not automatically called. Management has not done ANYTHING to demonstrate an increased vigilance about fire safety. Upon my move-in, I encountered empty fire extinguishers in my unit and in the breezeway, I did not have the number of smoke detectors required by fire code, and I'm pretty sure my wired-in smoke detector doesn't detect smoke. I spoke to another resident who discovered the only smoke detector in his unit was located at floor level under his couch. Another resident told me they discovered their smoke detector didn't work when they accidentally started a stove fire. And a friend who works at the Red Cross fire safety hotline informed me they have fielded many, many calls from this complex's tenants concerned about a lack of functional smoke detectors. In addition, I confirmed with an electrical engineering friend that my appliances are wired in a manner that is non-compliant with building code. Meanwhile, the lease has several fire safety rules that I've observed are completely unenforced, such as a prohibition on grilling on patios/balconies.\n\n Ongoing - there is a drain backup issue that has necessitated many water shutoffs and repairs, and I am concerned whether it might increase the risk of transmission of COVID19 between units (speaking of which, one maintenance worker doesn't believe in wearing masks, so he wears a bandanna that he is constantly reaching under and fiddling with). There are persistent, serious hazards throughout the complex: dead tree limbs overhanging the parking lots, rotten wooden floor boards in the breezeways, deteriorated sidewalks, stairs, and handrails, protruding pieces of metal and wiring, and many other signs of neglect. The dumpsters are perpetually full of old appliances from renovations, causing trash to overflow them and the smell of garbage to waft through the complex, and yet management has  charges a $56 annual trash fee, the cost of which wasn't disclosed in the lease. \n\nLastly, the landlord himself. Despite all these issues, I believe I've only received one direct response from him no matter how many times I've cc'd him in emails. However, every maintenance team member I've met has told me it's best to avoid direct dealings with him and that he is a mean and unpleasant person.\n\nI am sharing this review so others don't make the same mistake as me and hopefully save some lives, because it seems inevitable that another fire will occur here.",

    "reviewText": "She's really intense about doing chores 50/50. She keeps a spreadsheet of cleaning tasks that we both do each week, and has emailed me about missing chores months ago so I would do extra chores to make up for it. She's started keeping a record of our outdoor chores, including recording when she shovels snow WITH the amount of inches that it snowed. She's quick to monetize mistakes that I make such as getting hair dye on her hand towel and asking me to reimburse her for it. Living with her gives me anxiety, it's an unhealthy dynamic but I'm moving out in two weeks so it's the light at the end of the tunnel.",

    "reviewText": "A perfect example of how Ithaca's housing market is structured to leech students. After moving into a filthy house overflowing with trash and rotting food, the landlord has the audacity to accuse us as the reason that the house has \"never been this dirty\". Frankly, she should be grateful we managed to clean the house as much as we did; it is a disgusting decaying ancient property and only in Ithaca could it fetch as much rent as it does. Due to our rigorous cleaning, it certainly looks better than it did when we moved in. The heat and thermostats malfunctioned for most of the year, leaving some bedrooms 80 degrees or higher, virtually unlivable, and despite multiple requests, this was not resolved. Now she is withholding our security deposits based on a couple pictures of a stained refrigerator until we pay for professional cleaning--I am furious but sadly unsurprised that even in a pandemic situation, landlords are going out of their way to squeeze every possible cent from student tenants.",

    "reviewText": "Melissa had promised certain maintenance issues would be fixed (porch repair and window repair in the kitchen, for example) prior to move-in, but did not deliver on her promises as written in the lease. She had a maintenance person she knew and his teenage son come to do repairs in the house late at night, creating a mess in the house that he did not clean up and making it unable for us to find comfort in the house after work. She did not give ample warning when he came to work on the house, often letting us know a few hours before he planned to show up (if he showed up at all). As issues mounted and Melissa did not have work done on the house in a timely manner, I and my roommates requested copies of our lease (in case we needed to take legal action) and she gave us our copies while cursing at us and saying that she had never had tenants ask for copies of the lease before. While showing the apartment to prospective tenants, Melissa also lied when answering questions about pests in the house, telling someone that there had never been issues with pests when we had repeatedly emailed her about an issue with mice in the apartment. As well, upon moving into the apartment, I and my roommates discovered that the bathroom had large amounts of black mold in it that Melissa had not thought to have cleaned. I would not recommend renting from this landlord at all.",
